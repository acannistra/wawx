       " 'detailed_summary': 'A trace to 2\" of high density snow fell Wednesday morning on a warming trend as warm front lifted across the Cascades and should be well bonded to 2-4\" of higher elevation snow that fell on Tuesday. These small amounts of recent snow should be melting and rounding from rainfall currently saturating the snowpack will into the above treeline terrain on Wednesday afternoon.\\nRecent snowfall sits on well-drained, generally saturated snowpack with less saturation in the above treeline terrain, but multiple crusts extending into this terrain. There\\xa0are no notable layers of concern at this time. Thus, focus your attention on new storm instabilities in these zones moving forward.',\n",
